This project is inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=73744s lecture in youtube.
Thank you for this great course!

## Setup

You can download the package.json for necessary modules. 

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
## Getting Started

To summarize the project, I used hardhat framework to compile, deploy, and test smart contracts written in Solidity. The deployment and tests were made in hardhat framework with javascript language. Thanks to hardhat, I compiled the smart contratcs written with Solidity. Furthermore, hardhat allows us to run a virtual blockchain and run mocks for more sophisticated testing process.
